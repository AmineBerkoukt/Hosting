Initial Query: When you type "www.example.com" in your browser, your computer first sends this query to your Local DNS Resolver. This is usually provided by your ISP or could be a custom resolver like Google's 8.8.8.8.
Root DNS Query: If the resolver doesn't have the answer cached, it starts at the top of the DNS hierarchy by querying a Root DNS Server. This is like asking for directions at the highest level.
Root DNS Response: The root server doesn't know the specific IP address, but it knows where to find information about ".com" domains. It responds with a referral to the Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers that handle .com domains.
TLD Query: The resolver then asks the .com TLD server about "example.com". This is like narrowing down the search to the specific domain category.
TLD Response: The .com TLD server responds with information about which authoritative nameservers are responsible for "example.com". These servers are the final authority for this domain.
Authoritative Query: The resolver contacts the authoritative nameserver for example.com and asks for the specific record for "www.example.com".
Final Response: The authoritative server responds with the actual IP address (in this example, 93.184.216.34).
Client Response: The resolver sends this IP address back to your browser and typically caches it for future use to speed up subsequent requests.
Connection: Finally, your browser can establish a connection with the web server using the IP address.
